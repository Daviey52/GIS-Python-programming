# Working with maps

## Q1

You just got hired and it is your first day at work. Your manager is leaving for a conference for a week, and not having enough time to bring you up to speed and give you meaningful assignments he asks you to go through a whole set of mxd files, which are separated into folders by continent, country and state, and change the author of all those documents to your name. He will be leaving in the afternoon and told you could take the rest of the week off as soon as you are done, thinking this will take a while as there are hundreds of documents (your dataset contains only a small subsection).

Write a script that will accomplish this task, instead of you having to manually open each of these documents, which will also allow you to leave for the week before he leaves for the conference.

## Q2

There are some projects in your company with erroneous extents. Some data you have been using comes from external sources, and at times there are data entries with incorrect values causing your maps to have “blown” extents. You have been tasked to check all layers in the Practice2/Colorado.mxd document and list their extents, so problem layers can be identified and corrected.

A couple of data sources will have broken links so no extents be available.

## Q3

List all broken data sources in the Practice2/Colorado.mxd map document.

## Q4

Set all raster layers in the first data frame to be invisible.

## Q5

Due to some systems upgrades all shapefile data has been moved to a geodatabase. You task is to change all the layer paths from /Lesson8_Data to /Lesson8_Data/Practice5/Practice5.gdb. Use the /Lesson8_Data/Practice5/Colorado.mxd for this problem.
