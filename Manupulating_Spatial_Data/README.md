# Manupulating Spatial Data

For each county calculate the total numbers of wells that fall into that county, and update the county
table with the total count. Also calculate the well density â€“ i.e. how many wells there are per area
unit, and update the table with that value as well. The NoWells and Density fields have already been
added to the counties shapefile.
