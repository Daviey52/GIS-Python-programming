# Working with maps

## Q1

Use the Lesson8.mxd to create a PDF document that will contain a map for each county in the counties feature class. Change the title of each map to the name of the county being shown. Scale the map a bit so it shows an area just a bit larger than the actual extent.

## Q2

Change the spatial reference of the data frame in Lesson8.mxd from UTM 13, NAD83 to un-projected NAD83. You can obtain the projection information from the NAD83.shp shape file.
